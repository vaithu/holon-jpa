# Holon platform JPA module

> Latest release: [5.2.0](#obtain-the-artifacts)

This is the base __JPA__ module of the [Holon Platform](https://holon-platform.com), which provides base support for the _Java Persistence API_.

The module provides the `holon-jpa-bean-processors` artifact, which provides a set of Holon _bean property_ and _bean property set_ post processors to deal with JPA entity annotations, using it to configure bean properties at bean introspection time.

See the module [documentation](https://docs.holon-platform.com/current/reference/holon-jpa.html) for details.

Just like any other platform module, this artifact is part of the [Holon Platform](https://holon-platform.com) ecosystem, but can be also used as a _stand-alone_ library.

See the [platform documentation](https://docs.holon-platform.com/current/reference) for further details.

## Code structure

See [Holon Platform code structure and conventions](https://github.com/holon-platform/platform/blob/master/CODING.md) to learn about the _"real Java API"_ philosophy with which the project codebase is developed and organized.

## Getting started

### System requirements

The Holon Platform is built using __Java 8__, so you need a JRE/JDK version 8 or above to use the platform artifacts.

### Releases

See [releases](https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-jpa/releases) for the available releases. Each release tag provides a link to the closed issues.

### Obtain the artifacts

The [Holon Platform](https://holon-platform.com) is open source and licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE.md). All the artifacts (including binaries, sources and javadocs) are available from the [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central) repository.

The Maven __group id__ for this module is `com.holon-platform.jpa` and a _BOM (Bill of Materials)_ is provided to obtain the module artifacts:

_Maven BOM:_
```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.holon-platform.jpa</groupId>
        <artifactId>holon-jpa-bom</artifactId>
        <version>5.2.0</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencyManagement>
```

See the [Artifacts list](#artifacts-list) for a list of the available artifacts of this module.

### Using the Platform BOM

The [Holon Platform](https://holon-platform.com) provides an overall Maven _BOM (Bill of Materials)_ to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts:

_Platform Maven BOM:_
```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.holon-platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
        <version>${platform-version}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencyManagement>
```

See the [Artifacts list](#artifacts-list) for a list of the available artifacts of this module.

### Build from sources

You can build the sources using Maven (version 3.3.x or above is recommended) like this: 

`mvn clean install`
